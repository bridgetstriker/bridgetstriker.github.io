    <h1>He learned, almost too late...</h1>
    <p>He learned, almost too late, that man is a feeling creature… and, because of it, the greatest in the universe. He learned, too late for himself, that men have to find their own way, to make their own mistakes. There can’t be any gift of perfection from outside themselves. And when men seek such perfection, they find only death, fire, loss, disillusionment … the end of everything that’s gone forward.</p>
    
    <p>Men have always sought an end to toil and misery. But it can’t be given, it has to be achieved. There is hope, but it has to come from inside… man himself.</p>
